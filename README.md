### Prerequisites
 - [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net)  
 - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

### Build
Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described afterwards depending on the way you choose.

#### Maven based build
This is the recommended way for taking part in the development.  
Please check, whether following prerequisites are installed on your machine:
- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net) or a similar JDK 11 compatible VM  
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)

#### Build Docker Image
This project also supports building a Docker image for local testing (Docker image should not be used for productive environments).

To build the Docker image enable the maven profile ```docker``` and build the project:

```shell script
mvn clean install -P docker
```

A directory ```docker``` will be created in ```target``` directory.
Now open a shell with working directory within the created directory and execute

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```

The EFGS Docker image will be built. Also a MySQL database will be created. After that both start up and EFGS service is available on localhost port 8080.

#### API documentation  
Along with the application there comes a [swagger2](https://swagger.io) API documentation, which you can access in your web browser when the efgs-gateway-service applications runs:

    <base-url>/swagger

Which results in the following URL on your local machine:
http://localhost:8080/swagger

## Documentation  

Additional documentation can be found in the folder [docs](./docs/).
