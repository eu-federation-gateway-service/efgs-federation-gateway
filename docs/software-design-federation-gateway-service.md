# Software Design European Federation Gateway Service
by Alexander Stiefel (alexander.stiefel@t-systems.com)

##	Introduction
This documents describes detailed aspects of the implementation of the European Federation Gateway Service. It is closely related to the document [European Proximity Tracing An Interoperability Architecture](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf), 
to which it adds details. Target audience for this document are software engineers who want to get a better understanding of the insight of the implementation to be able to contribute.

This document is not finished and major aspects are missing.
This document is still in proposal state, meaning feedback is welcome and will change its content.


#	Overview
##	Purpose of the Software System
Many countries are developing proximity tracing apps to reduce the spreading of COVID-19, generally using the Exposure Notifications API from Google and Apple. 
While these national solutions reflect the specifics of each country a solution is required to allow interoperablity between those national solutions. 

This software implements a pan european solution a "European Federation Gateway Service" allowing national backends to uploads the keys of newly infected people 
 and downloads the diagnosis keys from the other countries participating in this scheme. 

##	Core Entities
|Entity|	Definition|	
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Diagnosis Key|	|
| Batch| An ordered set of diagnostic keys	|
| Upload Tag| Unique Logical Name for uploads | 		
| Batch Tag Name | Only relevant for downloads |

# Software Design

## Database Isolation Level

[Hypothesis] Need to use the highest isolation level TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE to isolate upload, download 
and batching operations.

## Monitoring
## Audit Logging
The purpose of the audit logging is to track the usage of the system.

### Log File Structure

The target environment for the service is a Apache Tomcat Server. So all log output will be written to stdout
which is redirected to `catalina.out` log file. So the content of this file needs to be collected by the Ops team.

### Log Message Structure

All log messages are following one format. The log format is inspired by the Splunk best practices document ([link](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/developapps/addsupport/logging/loggingbestpractices/))

Each log message contains key value pairs which will represent the required data.
All of these log messages are consisting of mandatory and additional fields. The mandatory fields are always at the begin of a log message.
 The key value pairs are connected by a "=" and seperated by  "," followed by a space. If the value consists of more than one word, the value will be wrapped within double quotes.
 Multiple log messages are seperated by a new line.
 The following mandatory fields will be sent with each log message:

| Field      | Content                                          | Example Value                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| timestamp  | ISO-8601 formatted timestamp (always UTC)        | 2020-08-04T16:44:45.999Z                |
| level      | Log Level                                        | INFO                                   |
| hostname   | The hostname of the current node                 | srv01                                  |
| pid        | Process ID                                       | 44929                                  |
| trace      | Correlation ID for tracing                       | d058309145b9f7a3                       |
| span       | Span ID for tracing                              | d058309145b9f7a3                       |
| thread     | ID of the thread                                 | main                                   |
| class      | The class from which the message is comming from | e.i.f.service.DiagnosisKeyBatchService |
| message    | Information about what has happened              | started document batching process      |
| exception* | Stack Trace, if available                        | org.springframew...                    |

Example:
```
timestamp="2020-08-04 17:19:46.038", level=INFO, pid=44929, trace=e7d394f3b0431c68, span=e7d394f3b0431c68, thread=scheduling-1, class=e.i.f.service.DiagnosisKeyBatchService, message="started document batching process", exception=""
```

*exception field will only be written to log file. In console stack traces will be printed directly.

These key-value-pairs can be followed by additional attributes. The additional attributes are individual for each log message.

# Integration into Data Center Infrastructure

## Load Balancer Integration
The load balancer terminates TLS, executes the mutual TLS authentication 
and forwards the http request to a worker node.

The IP of the load balancer is assigned to  registered domain name.

To allow authentication of the http request the load balancer adds header
 attributes containing meta information about the client certificate used to 
 authenticate the request.

## Reverse Proxy
- do we really need a reverse proxy

## Database
mySQL
- encryption during transport?
- encryption at rest?
- HA, how?
- backup/restore, how?

## Log Analytics/Monitoring Integration
## Secret Management
where can we store secrets like user/pwd for DB connections

## Data Center Access
### Access for Deployment
### Access for Operations
### Access for Developer


# Security

In this section, we define the security concept and security requirements for the Federation Gateway. The meaning of the words "MUST", "MAY", and "SHOULD" is defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119). To each requirement, an identifier, in the format "SecReq-{Number}", is assigned. 

## 1. Definitions 

**Client**: It refers to a National Backend (see [Federation Gateway Architecture Specification](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf)) that uploads or downloads diagnosis keys to/from the Federation Gateway. In the section "Client Authentication", Client and National Backend are used interchangeably. 

**Federation Gateway Components**

* **Load Balancer**: The component that receives the clients' requests (e.g., upload or download) and forwards them to the Federation Gateway Service after successful execution of the TLS protocol. 

* **Service**: The component that processes the clients' requests (e.g., upload or download) after successful client authentication. 

* **Database**: The component where the information (e.g., thumbprint) of the clients' certificates is stored.

* **HTTP Proxy**: The component that sends notifications (see Callback section) to the national backends after successful execution of the TLS protocol. 

**National Backend Certificates**

* **Authentication Certificate**: The certificate sent by a Client (National Backend) when executing mutual TLS with the Federation Gateway Load Balancer. This certificate is used to authenticate a Client.

* **Signing Certificate**: The certificate containing the public key which is used to verify the signature of a diagnosis key batch. This certificate is part of the Batch Signature (PKCS#7 Object).

* **Callback Certificate or National Backend Server Certificate**: The (server) certificate of a National Backend used for the TLS connections when the National Backend receives notifications (see Callback section) from the Federation Gateway. This certificate will be validated by the Federation Gateway HTTP Proxy.

**Batch Signature**: A [PKCS#7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652) object containing, among others, the signature of a diagnosis key batch and the Signing Certificate.

**Client Authentication**: The process in which a Client is authenticated (using its Authentication Certificate) and authorized to request a diagnosis key upload or download.

**Certificate Thumbprint/Fingerprint**: Hash value of a certificate. We have defined the SHA-256 hash function for calculation of the fingerprint. In this document, certificate hash, certificate fingerprint, and certificate thumbprint are used interchangeably. 

## 2. Client Authentication

As shown in the figure below, the Federation Gateway (FG) Load Balancer authenticates the Clients (National Databases) via mTLS. Then, the clients' requests are forwarded to the FG Service, which validates the Client Authentication Certificate against a whitelist stored in the database. Once the certificate has been successfully verified, the FG Service passes the requests to the corresponding endpoints (e.g., upload or download).

![Client Authentication Overview](EFGS-client-authentication.svg "Client Authentication")

**SecReq-001**  All the clients' requests (e.g., upload diagnostic key batch) MUST be authenticated. 

### 2.1. Load Balancer

**SecReq-002**  The Load Balancer MUST perform mutual TLS (mTLS) with the clients (national backends).  

**SecReq-003**  The Load Balancer MUST implement TLS termination.

#### 2.1.1. Certificate Validation

**SecReq-004**  If the client's certificate is not sent during the TLS handshake protocol, the Load Balancer MUST reject the client's request.

**SecReq-005**  If the client's certificate has expired, the Load Balancer MUST reject the client's request. The expiration is determined by the “notAfter” field (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-22)) of the certificate. 

**SecReq-006**  The Load Balancer MUST maintain a bundle containing the root CA certificates or intermediate CA certificates needed to verify (trust) the clients' authentication certificates. If a national backend uses a self-signed client authentication certificate, this certificate MUST be added to the CA bundle. 

**SecReq-007**  The Load Balancer MUST validate the client's certificate chain using its CA bundle (SecReq-006). If validation fails, the Load Balancer MUST reject the client's request. 

**SecReq-008**  The Load Balancer MAY maintain a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-54)). 

**SecReq-009**  If SecReq-008 is fulfilled, the Load Balancer MUST reject a request, if the client's certificate is present in the CRL. 

#### 2.1.2. Request Forwarding

**SecReq-010**  If the client's certificate was successfully validated, the Load Balancer MUST forward the corresponding request to the FG Service via HTTP. 

**SecReq-011**  When a client's request is forwarded to the FG Service (See SecReq-010), the Load Balancer MUST add the following HTTP headers to the request:

| HTTP Header         | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| X-SSL-Client-SHA256 |	SHA-256 hash value of the DER encoded client's certificate. The so-called certificate fingerprint or thumbprint.                         |
| X-SSL-Client-DN	  | The subject Distinguished Name (DN) of the client's certificate (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-23) and [RFC 1719](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1779#page-6)). The DN MUST contain the Country (C) attribute.  |

### 2.2. Federation Gateway Service 

**SecReq-012**  The Federation Gateway (FG) Service MUST authenticate the clients' requests using the information sent in the HTTP requests (see SecReq-011) and the certificate information stored in the FG Database.

**SecReq-013**  To authenticate a client, the FG Service MUST perform the following steps:

1. Extract the value of the *X-SSL-Client-SHA256* and *X-SSL-Client-DN* headers from the HTTP request forwarded by the Load Balancer (see SecReq-011).

2. Extract the Country (C) attribute from the X-SSL-Client-DN value.

3. Query the FG Database using the X-SSL-Client-SHA256 value and the Country (C) attribute. Also, the certificate type (see SecReq-019) MUST be used in the query. In this case, the type is: AUTHENTICATION.

	1. If the query does not return any record, the FG Service MUST reject the client's request.

	2. If the query returns a record, the FG Service MUST check whether the certificate has not been revoked. If the certificate was already revoked, the FG Service MUST reject the request. Otherwise continue with step 4.

4. If the client’s request was authenticated successfully, the FG Service MUST forward the request to the corresponding endpoint (e.g., download or upload endpoint).

#### 2.2.1. Logging

**SecReq-014**  The FG Service MUST log each authentication attempt using the information of the X-SSL-Client-DN header.   

**SecReq-015**  The FG Service MUST use the log format defined by the Cyber Defense Center (CDC) **TODO:TBD**.   
 
## 3. Batch Signature 

### 3.1. PKCS#7

**SecReq-016**  The batch signature MUTS be generate based on the [RFC 5652](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652) standard.

**SecReq-017**  The PKCS#7 object MUST contain the Signing Certificate. 

**SecReq-018**  The "certificates" field MUST only contain the Signing Certificate.

**SecReq-019**  The PKCS#7 object MUST NOT contain the signed data (batch). The "eContent" field MUST be omitted (defined as "external signature" in the [PKCS#7 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5652)).

**SecReq-020**  The PKCS#7 MUST NOT be used to disseminate Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

**SecReq-021**  The PKCS#7 object MUST be sent Base64 encoded to the Federation Gateway.

### 3.2. Signature Verification

The uploaded diagnostic keys must be signed at a abstract content level, which means 
not the content transferred via wire is signed but instead a constructed abstract 
content based on the transferred data.

**SecReq-022**  To create the signature and/or to verify it the diagnosis key data has be transformed 
into a byte stream with the structure defined below.  

The definition uses extended Backus–Naur form (ISO/IEC 14977)

ByteStream = DiagnosisKeyBatch ;

DiagnosisKeyBatch = { DiagnosisKey } ;

DiagnosisKey = keyData, rollingStartIntervalNumber, rollingPeriod, transmissionRiskLevel, visitedCountries, origin, verificationType ;


| Order        | Fieldname     | Start at Pos. |  Bytes  |Type (protobuf)	| Notes  |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------- | -------------- | ------ |
| 1            | keyData       | 0             | k | bytes | UTF-8 encoding | 
| 2            | rollingStartIntervalNumber       | k + 1             |4 | uint32 |Big endian| 
| 3            | rollingPeriod       | k + 5             |4 | uint32 |Big endian| 
| 4            | transmissionRiskLevel       | k + 9             |4 | int32 |Big endian| 
| 5            | visitedCountries       | k + 13             |c \* 2 | repeated strings |c = number of countries Each country (e.g., DE) has 2 bytes. UTF-8 encoding.Ascending alphabetic order (e.g., DE, NL, UK).| 
| 6            | origin       | (k + 13) + (c * 2)             |2 | string | UTF-8 encoding. | 
| 7            | reportType       |(k + 13) + (c * 2) + 2             |4 | int32 |Big endian| 
| 8            | daysSinceOnsetOfSymptoms       |(k + 13) + (c * 2) + 6             |4 | uint32 |Big endian| 

A DiagnosisKeyBatch can contain more than one DiagnosisKey. To make sure that the signer (National Backends) and 
verifier (Federation Gateway) process the same byte stream, the DiagnosisKey objects in the DiagnosisKeyBatch must be 
sorted by KeyData (see method **sortBatchByKeyData** in [BatchSignatureUtils.java](https://github.com/eu-federation-gateway-service/efgs-federation-gateway/blob/master/src/main/java/app/coronawarn/interop/federationgateway/utils/BatchSignatureUtils.java)).   

### 3.3. Certificate Verification

**SecReq-023**  The Federation Gateway (FG) upload endpoint MUST validate the Signing Certificate, which is sent in the PKCS#7 object (see SecReq-017), based on the requirements specified below.

**SecReq-024**  If the Signing Certificate has expired, the FG upload endpoint MUST reject the upload request. The expiration is determined by the "notAfter" field (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#page-22)) of the certificate.

**SecReq-025**  The FG upload endpoint MUST verify the signature of the Signing Certificate. If validation failed, the FG upload endpoint MUST reject the upload request.

**SecReq-026**  To verify whether a Signing Certificate is whitelisted, the FG upload endpoint MUST execute the next steps:

1. Extract the *Origin* value from the DiagnosisKeyBatch (see [Federation Gateway Architecture Specification](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf)).

2. Extract the *Country (C)* attribute from the X-SSL-Client-DN request header (see SecReq-011).

3. Compare the *Origin* with the *Country*. 

	1. If the Origin is not equal to Country, the upload endpoint MUST reject the signature, and thus, reject the upload request. Otherwise, continue with step 4.

4. Extract the signing certificate (DER encoded) from the PKCS#7 object.

5. Calculate the SHA-256 value of the extracted signing certificate.

6. Query the FG Database using the calculated SHA-256 value and the Country (C) attribute. Also, the certificate type (see SecReq-028) MUST be used in the query. In this case, the type is: SIGNING.

	1. If the query does not return any record, the upload endpoint MUST reject the signature, and thus, reject the upload request.

	2. If the query returns a record, the upload endpoint MUST verify that the certificate has not been revoked. If the certificate was already revoked, the upload endpoint MUST reject the signature, and thus, reject the upload request.

## 4. Callback

The Federation Gateway provides a notification service (callback), which informs the national backends when a new batch is available (see [Federation Gateway Architecture Specification](https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/ehealth/docs/mobileapps_interoperabilitydetailedelements_en.pdf)) . The Federation Gateway Service sends the notifications via an HTTP Proxy, which performs mutual TLS with the national backends. 

**TODO:** The requirements defined in this section still need to be analyzed. For example, questions to be answered are, how exactly the thumbprint of the Callback Certificate is going to verified by the HTTP Proxy? which HTTP proxy could fulfill the requirements defined below? 

![Callback Overview](EFGS-callback.svg "Callback Overview")

### 4.1. Federation Gateway Service

**SecReq-TBD**	 The Federation Gateway Service MUST send the notifications to the national backends via the HTTP Proxy component.

**SecReq-TBD**	 The Federation Gateway Service MUST add the following HTTP header to the notification requests:

| HTTP Header |	Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| X-SSL-Server-SHA256 |	SHA-256 hash value of the national database server certificate. |

### 4.2.  HTTP Proxy

**Note:** the terms *national backend server certificate* and *callback certificate* are used interchangeably. These terms are defined in section **1. Definitions**.

**SecReq-TBD**	 The HTTP Proxy MUST perform mutual TLS (mTLS) with the national backends.  

**SecReq-TBD**	 The HTTP Proxy MUST implement TLS termination (see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TLS_termination_proxy)).

**SecReq-TBD**	 The HTTP Proxy MUST stop sending a notification, if the national backend server certificate has expired.  The expiration is determined by the "notAfter" field (see RFC 5280) of the certificate. 

**SecReq-TBD**  The HTTP Proxy MUST maintain a bundle containing the root CA certificates or intermediate CA certificates needed to verify (trust) the callback certificates. If a national backend uses a self-signed callback certificate, this certificate MUST be added to the CA bundle. 

**SecReq-TBD**  The HTTP Proxy MUST validate a callback certificate chain using the CA bundle (see previous requirement). If validation fails, the HTTP Proxy MUST stop sending the notification. 

**SecReq-TBD**   Apart from the certificate validation during the TLS Handshake protocol, the HTTP Proxy MUST perform the following validation steps:
                 
1. Calculate the thumbprint of the Callback Certificate, which is sent by the National Backend during the TLS Handshake. 
                 
2. Compare Callback Certificate' thumbprint with the value of the *X-SSL-Server-SHA256* header, which was added by the Federation Gateway Service. 
                 
3. If the thumbprints are not equal, the HTTP Proxy MUST stop sending the notification.  

**SecReq-TBD**	 The HTTP Proxy MUST forward (only HTTP, no TLS) the responses of the national backends to the Federation Gateway Service. 

**SecReq-TBD**	 If a notification request is not successfully sent to a National Backend, the HTTP Proxy MUST inform the Federation Gateway Service that an error (e.g., Callback Certificate validation failed) occurred when sending the request. 

## 5. Certificate Handling

### 5.1. Certificates Information Storage

**SecReq-027**  The information of the National Backends' certificates (Authentication, Signing, and Callback) MUST be stored in a table (e.g., certificate)  of the Federation Gateway Database.

**SecReq-028**  The certificates information table SHOULD have the following fields:

| Fieldname | MySQL Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| thumbprint| CHAR (64) 	  | SHA-256 (hexadecimal string representation) of a Client's certificate |
| country	| CHAR (2)		  | [Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) (e.g., FR) of the country a certificate belongs to |
| type		| ENUM			  | A certificate can have the following types: <br> AUTHENTICATION <br> SIGNING <br> CALLBACK |
| revoked	| TINYINT (1)	  | 0: The certificate is not revoked <br> 1: The certificate was revoked |

###	5.2. Operations 

#### 5.2.1. Insert

**SecReq-029**  Before using the Federation Gateway, the National Backends MUST provide the SHA-256 hash values of their certificates, including the purpose (e.g., Client Authentication) of each one of those certificates.

**SecReq-030**  The Federation Gateway operator MUST insert the certificates information, which is provided by the National Backends, into the FG database.

#### 5.2.2. Revoke

**SecReq-031**  The National Backends MUST inform the Federation Gateway operator when a certificate(s) needs to be revoked. The National Backends MUST provide a list containing the fingerprints of the certificates that must be revoked. 

**SecReq-032**  When a revocation list is received from a National Backend, the Federation Gateway operator MUST revoke all the certificates in the list by setting the "revoked" field of that certificate entry to "1" (see SecReq-028).

## 6. Certificate Requirements 

**SecReq-033**  All certificates MUST be complied with the X.509 version 3 certificate standard (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)).

**SecReq-034**  All certificates MUST contain a Distinguished Name (DN) in the subject field.

**SecReq-035**  The Distinguished Name (DN) MUST have the Country (C) attribute, containing the [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) (e.g., NL) of the National Backend. 

**SecReq-036**  The Signing Certificates, which are used to verify the batch signature, CAN be self-signed. (this subject is likely to change)

**SecReq-037**  The Signing Certificates SHOULD set the Key Usage extension to "digitalSignature" (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3)).

**SecReq-038**  The Authentication Certificates, which are used to authenticate the National Backends, SHOULD set the Key Extended Usage extension to "clientAuth" (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)).

**SecReq-039**  The Callback Certificates, which are used for callback operations (see Callback section), SHOULD set the Key Extended Usage extension to "serverAuth" (see [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.12)).

**SecReq-040**  A Callback Certificate MUST have the host name (e.g., national.backend.com) of the National Backend in the Common Name (CN) attribute of the certificate's subject.  

**SecReq-041**  A Callback Certificate MUST have the host name (e.g., national.backend.com) of the National Backend in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension.  

### 6.1. Cryptographic Requirements  

**SecReq-042**  The cryptographic operations performed with the National Backends certificates MUST fulfill the following requirements:

| Signature Algorithm |	Minimum Key Length | Hash Algorithm |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| RSA				  | 2024			   | SHA-256 <br> SHA-384 <br> SHA-512 |
| ECDSA				  | 250				   | SHA-256 <br> SHA-384 <br> SHA-512 |

The above requirements were defined based on the [BSI recommendations](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR02102/BSI-TR-02102.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10) for cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
